## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI toolkit
- **Navigation Compose** - Screen navigation
- **ViewModel & LiveData** - State management
- **Location Services** - GPS tracking
- **Google Maps Compose** - Interactive map display
- **Material Design 3** - UI components
- **Accompanist Permissions** - Permission handling

### Permissions
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - GPS tracking
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - Backup location
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Background tracking
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` - Location service

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
2. Android SDK with minimum API level 30
3. Device or emulator with GPS/location services

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync project with Gradle files
4. Set up Android SDK path in `local.properties`:
   ```properties
   sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
   ```
5. **Get a Google Maps API key**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable Maps SDK for Android
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `AndroidManifest.xml` with your actual API key
6. Build and run the app

### Usage
1. **Grant location permission** when prompted
2. **Start a run** by tapping the play button
3. **View live stats** including distance, time, pace, and speed
4. **Pause/Resume** as needed during your run
5. **Stop** the run to save it to history
6. **View history** in the History tab

## App Screens

### Running Screen
- Large time display as the main stat
- **Interactive map** showing real-time route tracking
- Distance, pace, speed, and status cards
- Start/pause/stop floating action buttons
- Permission request handling

### History Screen
- List of all completed runs
- **Compact map view** for each running session
- Date, time, and duration for each session
- Distance, pace, calories, and speed statistics
- Empty state when no runs exist

### Route Detail Screen
- **Full-screen map view** with complete route
- Detailed statistics and session information
- Start/end markers and route polyline
- Comprehensive running metrics

## Data Tracking

### Tracked Metrics
- **Distance**: Calculated from GPS coordinates
- **Duration**: Total time excluding pauses
- **Pace**: Minutes per kilometer
- **Speed**: Current and average speeds
- **Calories**: Estimated based on distance and duration
- **Location points**: GPS coordinates for route mapping

### Calculations
- Distance uses GPS coordinate differences
- Pace calculated as duration/distance
- Calories use MET (Metabolic Equivalent) values
- Speed derived from location updates

## Code Architecture

### MVVM Pattern
- **Model**: Data classes (RunningSession, RunningStats)
- **View**: Composable UI screens
- **ViewModel**: Business logic and state management

### State Management
- **StateFlow** for reactive UI updates
- **Coroutines** for background operations
- **Flow** for location updates

### UI Components
- **Cards** for displaying statistics
- **FABs** for primary actions
- **Bottom Navigation** for screen switching
- **Material Design 3** components throughout

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- ✅ Route mapping with Google Maps (implemented)
- Running goals and achievements
- Social sharing capabilities
- Workout plans and training programs
- Heart rate monitoring integration
- Weather information display
- Audio coaching and feedback
- Export routes to GPX/KML formats

**Important Notes**: 
- This app requires GPS/location services to function properly. Make sure to test on a physical device or emulator with location simulation enabled.
- **Google Maps API Key Required**: You need a valid Google Maps API key to use the map features. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `AndroidManifest.xml` with your actual API key from Google Cloud Console.
- Map features will not work without a valid API key.

## Troubleshooting

### "No route data" Message
If you see "No route data" on the map, try these steps:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure you've replaced `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `AndroidManifest.xml` with your actual Google Maps API key
2. **Enable APIs**: In Google Cloud Console, make sure you've enabled:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Places API (if using autocomplete)
3. **Location Permissions**: 
   - Grant location permission when prompted
   - Enable "Precise location" if available
   - Check that location services are enabled in device settings
4. **GPS Signal**: 
   - Go outdoors for better GPS reception
   - Wait a few seconds for GPS to initialize
   - Try restarting the app if location isn't working

### Debugging Logs
Check Android Studio Logcat for these debug messages:
- `LocationService`: Shows GPS permission and location updates
- `RunningViewModel`: Shows route data processing
- `RunningScreen`: Shows map data being passed to components
- `RunningMapView`: Shows what data the map is receiving

### Common Issues
- **Emulator**: Use extended controls to set location in Android emulator
- **Indoor testing**: GPS may not work well indoors - try near a window or outdoors
- **API Key restrictions**: Make sure your API key isn't restricted to specific package names
- **Rate limiting**: Check if you've exceeded Google Maps API quota
